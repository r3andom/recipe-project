        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome 
                made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and 
                black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern 
                form, with its current name, in the middle of 
                the 20th century.
            </p>

            <p>
                The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, 
                Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the 
                two.Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but 
                fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini 
                are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta 
                are used for the meat component, but lardons 
                of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside 
                Italy.
